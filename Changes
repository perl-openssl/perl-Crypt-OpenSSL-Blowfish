    [Legacy Notice]
    OpenSSL version 3 considers Blowfish to be a legacy encryption
    method.  Users of this module (if any) need to consider moving to
    other encryption methods.

    [Compatibility Notice]
    This version maintains compatibility with the older versions.
    However, this is not fully compatible with openssl's bf-ecb cipher.
    See the documentation relating to how to use the compatible version.

    [Significant rewrite]
    - OpenSSL 3 has deprecated the use of low-level functions.
    - Update to use OpenSSL v3 EVP_ api for openssl >= 3.0.0
    - Significant changes to the module while retaining compatibity with
      the previous versions.  As Blowfish is now outdated and considered
      legacy by OpenSSL this rewrite was done ot of interest not necessity.
